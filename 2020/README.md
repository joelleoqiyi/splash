## CodeCoders

---

**Opportunity identified:**

- Talent shortage in the field of engineering due to lack of interest in these fields. 
- STEM and engineering education is not widespread in schools despite the increasing importance of STEM.
- Possibly turning off new-comers with daunting initial experience of experimenting with engineering (which is something new to most people) hence by reducing difficulty of programming, aiming to attract new-comers to explore STEM

---

**Proposed Idea and platform:**

- Artificial Intelligence which transforms the user’s plain text input into actual executable code which then can be uploaded into the user’s Arduino. 

- Inputs will be summarized into fix outputs as "keys" for our database based on the identified keywords

- After the code is generated, user can still edit/finalise the code and any specific values in the form of block programming and be able to copy the actual code with a button click

---

**Target Audience:**
- Students who are interested in experimenting with engineering but are discouraged by the difficulty of coding/programming

---

**Originality and Value:**
- Experimenting with engineering/Arduino is less daunting as the difficulty of coding is reduced
- Currently, there is no platform that converts english words to code which can be executed on hardware (hardware integrations)

**Type of Dataset used:** 
- Adapting from the popular Gigaword dataset that contains 4 million articles and their headlines.

**Future Plans:**
- Integrating with other prototyping systems or online emulators allowing for more scalability
